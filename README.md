# Pint OS

* Vanilla version as it appears directly after extraction
* See https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos.html

Reminders:
* Don't forget to change PATH directory to the appropriate path of src/utils before sourcing it
  * Added utility script pintos/fix_directories
    * Run it to change PATH and other known directories to current installation location
* If using Ubuntu, don't forget to allow `src/utils/pintos` to execute as a program
